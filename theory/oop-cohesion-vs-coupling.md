## [Cohesion vs Coupling](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3085285/difference-between-cohesion-and-coupling)

- Good software design has high cohesion and low coupling.

### Cohesion

- Cohesion refers to what the class (or module) can do.
- Low cohesion would mean that the class does a great variety of actions -it is broad, unfocused on what it should do.
- High cohesion means that the class is focused on what it should be doing, i.e. only methods relating to the intention of the class.
- Cohesion is the indication of the relationship within a module.

### Coupling

- Coupling refers to how related or dependent two classes/modules are toward each other.
- For low coupled classes, changing something major in one class should not affect the other.
- High coupling would make it difficult to change and maintain your code; since classes are closely knit together, making a change could require an entire system revamp.
- Coupling is the indication of the relationships between modules.
