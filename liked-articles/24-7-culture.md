## [Laws Banning After-Hours Email Won’t Fix Our 24/7 Work Culture](https://www.fastcompany.com/40559486/laws-banning-after-hours-email-wont-fix-our-24-7-work-culture)

- A new law could make it illegal for employers in New York City to require their employees to check their email accounts outside of official working hours.
- Similar legislation has already been passed in France.
- Because of technology, the lines have been blurred on when the workday begins and when the workday ends, and there are employers who take advantage of that fact.
- Can disconnecting only be achieved through legislation?
- Our overwired and digitally distracted world [is] slowly eroding our ability to focus, and worse yet, rewriting our brains.
- A lot of people today expect 24/7 responsiveness. If we can’t reach a client or employee via email, we text –or even call– them. But do we really need to be in crisis mode all the time?
- A lot of people have allowed themselves to be on 24/7 and don’t even know they have actively chosen this.
- The reality is that when we try to respond to everything all the time, we start making compromises. Our communication is not as deliberate, precise, or impactful. Slowing down and thinking about what you really want to communicate (even questioning whether you need to send a message) is a great place to start.
- Companies will have to recognize that work time really is finite; there are only so many hours in a day and a week. Companies need to ponder whether the increased distraction and decreased productivity is worth it in an open office space. With limited time, how could meetings [be] more impactful and effective? The trick is not to use up every hour of the workday, but rather to optimize the time we spend working so we can get more done in less time.
