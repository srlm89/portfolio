[The Most Honest Out-of-Office Message](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/out-of-office-message-email/562394/)

- Some weeks ago, I emailed a professor to ask for an interview for a story. Seconds later, I got his out-of-office response:

  > Thank you for your message. Email received between [these dates] will be deleted from this server eight hours from now.
Please send your message again after [this date].

- My bewilderment quickly mutated into offense. Of course we’re allowed to not check email while we’re on vacation.
But to not check what arrived when you were gone, how dare you?

- A minute later, it hit me. My reaction doesn’t seem ... healthy. But of course, nothing about email is, or has been for a long
time. In the 1990s, AOL would gleefully announce, ‘You’ve got mail!’ Today, Gmail celebrates the opposite: ‘No new mail!’

- Research has shown that returning to email after a brief hiatus can be stressful. A proposed law in New York would make it
illegal for business to contact employees by email or instant-messaging services when those employees are scheduled to be off.
This is reality in France, which last year enacted a “right to disconnect” law that allows workers to ignore work emails after
business hours.

- Surveys have shown that most emails we receive are pretty useless.

- Over the years, as the flow of emails has transformed from a drizzle into a deluge, we created folders and filters and labels,
granted access to algorithms to scour their contents, and archived message after message until the little red notification dot
disappeared. Our email boxes became a boundless ocean of mostly useless things and a few useful ones, waiting for us to wade in
every morning.
