## [The truth about ergonomic chairs and desks](https://www.fastcompany.com/90420022/are-ergonomic-chairs-and-desks-really-worth-it/)

- When it comes to neck pain, research shows that altering your workstation has little to no impact on whether you’ll develop problems. What does? Stress.

- Spinal pain is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, and its occurrence has increased dramatically over the past 25 years.

- It’s often said there are “good and bad postures” and that specific postures can contribute to spinal pain, but this belief is not supported by scientific evidence.

- Research shows that poor sleep, reduced physical activity, and increased stress appear to be more important factors.

### The posture myth

- So-called “ergonomic interventions” have little to no impact on whether a person develops neck pain.

- Those with neck pain [are] found to be getting less quality and quantity of sleep and were working in jobs with high strain.

- They [are] also less physically active and had depressed mood.

- Their bodies are essentially experiencing greater stress, and they notice more “muscle tension” in their neck.

### Sleep, exercise, and relaxation

- having a stronger neck, enjoying exercise —even simply walking a greater number of steps each day— have all been shown to protect against getting neck pain.

- This, along with making sure we don’t become sleep-deprived, less physically active, and stressed.

- Science seems to show that there may be no such thing as a “bad” posture after all.
