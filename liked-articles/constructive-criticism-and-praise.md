### [Good managers give constructive criticism—but truly masterful leaders offer constructive praise](https://qz.com/1010784/good-managers-give-constructive-criticism-but-truly-masterful-leaders-give-constructive-praise/)

- A boss’s willingness to give positive feedback \[is\] the strongest predictor of whether their direct reports perceive them to be effective, honest communicators.

- A 2015 survey found that 67% of employees whose managers communicated their strengths were fully engaged in their work, as compared to 31% of employees whose managers only communicated their weaknesses.

- One study found that high-performing teams receive nearly six times more positive feedback than less effective teams—evidence that positive reinforcement really does help the bottom line.

- It takes self-confidence to tell another person what they’re good at and why, with the underlying implication that you’re in a position to be able to discern such things.

- Such clarity allows the recipient to reflect on and internalize specific behaviors, without over- or underestimating their general competency. This specificity is especially important when offering praise for uncommon behaviors (like questioning a CEO). If employees don’t know that they were right to take a risk, they may shy away from repeating it in the future for fear that they’ll be judged.

- Employees who feel valued report better physical and mental health, and higher levels of work engagement, satisfaction, and motivation.

- Whenever possible it’s best to give constructive praise in person. Effective leadership is all about making an emotional connection with people in order to have a greater amount of influence. There’s no better platform for feedback, positive or negative, then a face-to-face discussion, given the impact of body language and tone of voice.

- Giving positive feedback is like giving a present—you fuss over it and worry maybe the other person won’t like it, but really, it makes both of you feel good.
