## [How to Be the Perfect Boss for Every Employee](https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/gretchen-rubin-leadership-4-tendencies-management-employees.html)

- People tend to respond to expectations in one of four ways:
  - Obligers: (which most people are) fulfill other people's expectations, but often fall short on their own expectations for themselves.
  - Questioners: need to fully understand an expectation and why it matters before they fulfill it.
  - Rebels: dislike all expectations, even from themselves.
  - Upholders: are good at fulfilling other people's expectations as well as their own, but can be rigid.

### Obligers

- The biggest tendency for both men and women. This is the one that most people belong to.
- They make great team members, great leaders, and they're often invaluable employees. They are the rock of the world.
- The downside of this is that, because Obligers are so good at fulfilling expectations, they're often subject to burnout.
- They can get pushed to the point "obliger rebellion." When that happens, it can have serious consequences as having the obliger leave the company.

### Questioners

- Questioners question all expectations. If they think it makes sense, they'll do it, no problem. If it fails their inner standard, they will push back.
- Anything inefficient, unjustified, or arbitrary is a big thing for questioners. They may drive you crazy with endless questions about a task or a decision.
- They can also get bogged down themselves with endless research, especially when making a decision.
- Setting limits on their decision-making process [can help] them fight this tendency.
- If you are thinking, _"I very firmly fit in all four"_ that also is a sign of a Questioner, because it means you respond in whatever way feels right to you in the circumstance.

### Rebels

- Rebels are the least common of the four tendencies. In the right circumstances, their achievements can be spectacular.
- They are so in touch with their passions and interests and values. If they decide they want to do something, they're unstoppable.
- If you ask or tell them to do something, they're very likely to resist.
- Trying to help them by reminding them, rescuing them, nudging, or encouraging them may actually ignite the spirit of resistance.
- The one useful thing you can do as a manager is tell the Rebel the consequences of a given action or inaction.

### Upholders

- They are great at meeting deadlines, and also great at setting boundaries and taking care of their own needs.
- They can sometimes seem a little cold and judgmental because things that come pretty easily to Upholders are not so easy for people of other tendencies.
- Upholders can also be rigid. It's very hard for them when things are ambiguous, and they can feel uneasy when it's not clear what the rules are or what success looks like.
