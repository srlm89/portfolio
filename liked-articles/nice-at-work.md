### [No Time to Be Nice at Work](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/opinion/sunday/is-your-boss-mean.html)

Mean bosses could have killed my father. I vividly recall walking into a hospital room outside of Cleveland to see my strong, athletic dad lying with electrodes strapped to his bare chest. What put him there? I believe it was work-related stress.

Rudeness and bad behavior have all grown over the last decades, particularly at work. How we treat one another at work matters. Insensitive interactions have a way of whittling away at people's health, performance and souls.

When people experience intermittent stressors like incivility for too long or too often, their immune systems pay the price. We also may experience major health problems, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and ulcers.

Bosses produce demoralized employees through a string of actions: walking away from a conversation because they lose interest; answering calls in the middle of meetings without leaving the room; openly mocking people by pointing out their flaws or personality quirks in front of others; reminding their subordinates of their "role" in the organization and "title"; taking credit for wins, but pointing the finger at others when problems arise. Employees who are harmed by this behavior, instead of sharing ideas or asking for help, hold back.

I've surveyed hundreds of people and asked people why they behaved uncivilly. Over half of them claim it is because they are overloaded, and more than 40 percent say they have no time to be nice. But respect doesn't necessarily require extra time. It's about how something is conveyed; tone and nonverbal manner are crucial.

Incivility also hijacks workplace focus. People working in an environment characterized by incivility miss information that is right in front of them. They are no longer able to process it as well or as efficiently as they would otherwise.

Incivility shuts people down in other ways, too. Employees contribute less and lose their conviction. Customers behave the same way. People [are] less likely to patronize a business that has an employee who is perceived as rude -whether the rudeness is directed at them or at other employees. Witnessing a short negative interaction leads customers to generalize about other employees, the organization and even the brand.

Many are skeptical about the returns of civility. A quarter believe that they will be less leader-like, and nearly 40 percent are afraid that they'll be taken advantage of if they are nice at work. Nearly half think that it is better to flex one's muscles to garner power. They are jockeying for position in a competitive workplace and don't want to put themselves at a disadvantage.

Why is respect -or lack of it- so potent? Charles Horton Cooley's 1902 notion of the "looking glass self" explains that we use others' expressions (smiles), behaviors (acknowledging us) and reactions (listening to us or insulting us) to define ourselves. How we believe others see us shapes who we are. We ride a wave of pride or get swallowed in a sea of embarrassment based on brief interactions that signal respect or disrespect. Individuals feel valued and powerful when respected. Civility lifts people. Incivility holds people down. It makes people feel small.

Although in surveys people say they are afraid they will not rise in an organization if they are really friendly and helpful, the civil do succeed. Behavior involving politeness and regard for others in the workplace pays off. Those seen as civil [are] twice as likely to be viewed as leaders. Civility elicits perceptions of warmth and competence. These two traits drive our impressions of others. These impressions dictate whether people will trust you, build relationships with you, follow you and support you.

The catch: There can be a perceived inverse relationship between warmth and competence. A strength in one can suggest a weakness of the other. Some people are seen as competent but cold -he's very smart, but people will hate working for him. Or they're seen as warm but incompetent -she's really friendly, but probably not very smart.

Leaders can use simple rules to win the hearts and minds of their people -with huge returns. Making small adjustments such as listening, smiling, sharing and thanking others more often can have a huge impact.

What about the jerks who seem to succeed despite being rude and thoughtless? Those people have succeeded despite their incivility, not because of it. Studies have shown that the No. 1 characteristic associated with an executive's failure is an insensitive, abrasive or bullying style.

Power can force compliance. But insensitivity or disrespect often sabotages support in crucial situations. Employees may fail to share important information and withhold efforts or resources. Sooner or later, uncivil people sabotage their success -or at least their potential. Payback may come immediately or when they least expect it, and it may be intentional or unconscious.

Across many decisions -whom to hire, who will be most effective in teams, who will be able to be influential- civility affects judgments and may shift the balance toward those who are respectful.

Given the enormous cost of incivility, it should not be ignored. We all need to reconsider our behavior. You are always in front of some jury. In every interaction, you have a choice: Do you want to lift people up or hold them down?
