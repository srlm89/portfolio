[Inbox Zero vs. Inbox 5,000: A Unified Theory](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/05/why-some-people-cant-stand-having-unread-emails/394031/)

- 1,328 unread-message notifications? I just can’t fathom how anyone lives like that. I'm not alone. One 2012 study found that
70 percent of work emails were attended to within six seconds of their arrival.

- This has led me to a theory that there are two types of emailers in the world: Those who can comfortably ignore unread
notifications, and those who feel the need to take action immediately.

- It takes people on average about 25 minutes to reorient back to a task when they get interrupted. Yes, that includes even brief
interruptions, like dashing off a quick response to an email. These interruptions are so integral to modern workflows, that when
people lack external interruptions, such as a coworker striking up a conversation, they voluntarily interrupt themselves —sometimes
by checking email.

- Few tasks have a sense of conclusion as neat and immediate as archiving or deleting an email. For that reason, neurotically tidy
people like me can't help but triage emails the moment they arrive.

- [But] there are opposing email sensibilities. Email might not be just a task, but a game. In the case of our phones, we see,
hear, or feel a notification alert show up, we open the app, and we are rewarded with something we like: a message from a friend,
a like, an upvote, or whatever. People who don’t mind notification pileups don’t perceive as much of a reward from getting retweets
or Facebook likes.

- What if actually there are people who care about technology as a part of their identity, and people who don’t?

- My email theory is really just a corollary of another, more expansive pop philosophy: Muppet Theory. Everyone is either a
Chaos Muppet (out-of-control, emotional, volatile) or an Order Muppet (neurotic, highly-regimented, averse to surprises).
