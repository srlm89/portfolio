### [How to Email](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/09/brevity-in-email/501986/)

Brevity is the highest virtue. Here are the basic guidelines that are working for me and, so, I propose for all of the world to adopt immediately:

#### No signoff

Best? Cheers? Thanks? None of the above.

### No greeting

Don’t waste time considering if “Dear,” or “Hey” or “[name]!” is appropriate. Just get right into it.

Greetings and closings are relics of the handwritten missive that persist only as matters of, ostensibly, formality. Foregoing them can seem curt or impolite. But it’s the opposite. Long, formal emails are impolite.

### Brevity signals respect. Three sentences or fewer.

Rarely does an email require more than three sentences. If it does, consider calling or getting together in person. Social interaction is healthy, and more time spent in the inbox isn’t likely to be.

### Check only two or three times a day.

Every time you check your email, you lose an additional 30 seconds or so that it takes to refocus your attention on whatever you were doing.
