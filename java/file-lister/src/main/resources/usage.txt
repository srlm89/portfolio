    Usage:
    
    Make snapshot of directory:
    ---------------------------
    
    $ java -jar file-list.jar -snapshot <path>
    
    It creates a snapshot of the directory indicated by <path>.
    
    
    List files by regex:
    --------------------
    
    $ java -jar file-list.jar -list <type> <path> <regex> <replacement>
    
    E.g.,

        java -jar file-list-jar-with-dependencies.jar -list -fs . "^(.*mp3)$" "\$1"
    
    It lists files from a directory structure. Only files matching the indicated regular
    expression <regex> are shown. Files are grouped by the indicated regular expression
    and they are shown with the <replacement> and not by their names.
    To list files from a directory, <type> should be "-fs" and <path> must indicate an
    existing directory. To list files from a snapshot file created with this program,
    <type> should be "-s" and <path> must be the path of a snapshot file. 
    
    
    Compare directories recursively:
    --------------------------------
    
    $ java -jar file-list.jar -compare <type> <path-1> <path-2>
    
    It compares two directory structures. The comparison can either be from the file system
    structure or from snapshots created with this program.
    To make a comparison from the file system, <type> should be "-fs" and two directory paths
    must be provided as <path-1> and <path-2>.
    To make a comparison from two snapshots, <type> should be "-s" and two snapshot file
    paths must be provided as <path-1> and <path-2>.
