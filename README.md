### Portfolio

I use this repository to showcase some small coding exercises I have programmed, which otherwise would not see the light of day. It is also a convenient place to present my coding skills and style.

The portfolio is divided by programming language and it includes exercises inspired by some courses taken for my MSc in Computer Science, or completely random ideas which I found the time to develop into real programs.

Overall, I do not have a favorite programming language. I tend to think that any programming language, given the proper amount of usage and time, can end up being unsatisfying.

What I like about programming is how it enables you to transform abstract thinking into a concrete and visible blueprint. In other words, in this case it is the other way around: _all that is air melts into solid_. And while the transition from one phase to the other takes place, those thoughts reveal themselves up to the last small detail.

I think this is one clear way to begin Doug Engelbart's _human intellect augmentation_.
